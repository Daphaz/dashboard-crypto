> For this project my challenge is not to use (for the moment) a database,
> to use redux for the state management of the application. To continue to work on my structure in SCSS and React/Redux.

## Description
> I wanted to work on a project of clone of an already existing site and a dynamic dashboard in react. while looking for design ideas on dribble, I came across [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/14742262-Unity-Dashboard-Kit-Exchange), then on [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/109404525/Unity-Dashboard-Kit-Exchange) and finally on a [demo](https://ui8-unity-exchange.herokuapp.com/) ... so why not put the two projects together in one et voilÃ .

**I find the project really beautiful! if you want to buy [the complete project of UI8 Design](https://ui8.net/ui8/products/unity-dashboard-kit--exchange)**
